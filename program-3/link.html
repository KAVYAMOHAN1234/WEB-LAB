<p> The MCA program is generally 2 years long, not 3 years, as the duration was reduced by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) for the academic year 2020-21. While some institutions may still offer a 3-year program or have lateral entry options for a 2-year course, the standard duration for a fresh MCA degree is now two years.
